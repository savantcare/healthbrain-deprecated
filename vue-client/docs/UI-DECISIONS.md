## Why does the patient app have a left side and a right side?

Left side shows the state of the patient on a particular date.

 Right side is to change the current state of the patient.

Psychiatrist needs to be able to look at multiple historical states to make decisions and change the current state.

## Why does the left side have two tabs on the top right corner?
The 1st tab shows the health components and the 2nd tab shows the non-health components. There is a master table of components. And each component is either a health component or a "not-health" component.
